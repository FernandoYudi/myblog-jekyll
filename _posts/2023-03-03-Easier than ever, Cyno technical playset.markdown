## Extends Duration The Cooldown Of Elemental Burst

When used during Cyno's Elemental Burst, Elemental Skill will extend the duration of Elemental Burst. Using Elemental Skill to extend the Cooldown can reduce the downtime of Burst to 3 seconds if you have enough Energy Recharge.

# Uses Of Cyno's Elemental Burst

# Elemental Burst

Imbue All Attacks With Electro Damage
While his Elemental Burst is active, all of Cyno's Normal, Charged, and Plunge attacks will be imbued with Electro. Combine with different setups in order to deal continuous Electro reactions before it expires!

# Resistance To Electro-Charged DMG and Boost Elemental Mastery
You will get a bonus of 100 EM during the Elemental Burst of Cyno. This makes Cyo an amazing character for Electro reaction focused teams.

# Shortens The Cooldown Of Elemental Skill
Elemental Skill
While Elemental Burst is active, the Elemental Skill animation and AoE is wider and changes the cooldown of it from 7 seconds to 3 seconds.
